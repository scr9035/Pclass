Readme.

Deviations from the game:

I included two monsters from the Monster class. 
The first is an Evil_robot. The robot has different metallic colors.
The second is a Doctoral_student. The DS is pale because they never leave the lab.
The DS is also weak but has many HP because it has a strong will to survive.

There are three character classes.
The third one has extra potions.

I included potions to restore HP. 

I created a Combat class which character and monster inherent from.
This class deals with dodging, attacking, running away, and blocking.

I tried to create a map. It worked well with print, but not self.c.send. 
I do not know why, and am kind of bummed by this fact. Oh well.

I also used color, because life is not black and white, and neither should gaming be.
Figuring it out was a pain in the booty. Stackexchange was helpful, but why python
gotta be print("\033[1;31mSo damn confusing!\033[1;m")
I've so very tired.
